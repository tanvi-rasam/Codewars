Q1] Clock shows h hours, m minutes and s seconds after midnight.

Your task is to write a function which returns the time since midnight in milliseconds.

Example:
h = 0
m = 1
s = 1

result = 61000

Solutions -

function past(h, m, s){
  //1
  return ((h * 60 * 60) + (m * 60) + s) * 1000 
  
  //2:
   //currTime in ms - midnight time in ms
  return Math.round(new Date().setHours(h,m,s) - new Date().setHours(0,0,0)); 
}

Q2] Given a string of digits, you should replace any digit below 5 with '0' and any digit 5 and above with '1'. Return the resulting string.

function fakeBin(x){
  //1:
  //return x.split('').map(x1 => x1 >= 5 ? 1 : 0).join('');
  
  //2:
  return x ? (x[0] >= 5 ? '1' : '0') + fakeBin(x.slice(1)) : ''; 
}

//3:
  return x.replace(/[0-4]/g, '0').replace(/[5-9]/g, '1');
  
Q3] Description:
Make a simple function called greet that returns the most-famous "hello world!".

Style Points
Sure, this is about as easy as it gets. But how clever can you be to create the most creative hello world you can think of? What is a "hello world" solution you would want to show your friends?

Solution-

// Write a function "greet" that returns "hello world!"
//1:
//const greet = () => 'hello world!';

//2:
function greet() {
  return 'hello world!';
}
